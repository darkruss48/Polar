# Polar
A simple, powerfull WT Performance Analyser for Dragon Ball Z : Dokkan Battle.

## Installation

Check the releases.

## Build

You might want to build your own version of Polar.
To do so, you need to download it using [QT](https://qt.io).
I made this client using my own static QT build (v6.8.0), which allows me to compile it and to share it without you needing to install QT.
If you build it yourself with the distribued version of QT (the dynamic one), it will work for you but you can't share your executable as it need to have QT installed on the computer to start.
Feel free to contact us (check [contact](#Contact)) if you need any help to compile it.
